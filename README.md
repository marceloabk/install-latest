Does what it says, install the latest dependencies and devDependencies from your package.json.

I know one's not supposed to just dump the latest packages on a project but I find it usefull sometimes when I want to get a clean install and work with the latest updates.

## Quick start

```
    npx install-latest
```

Done.
